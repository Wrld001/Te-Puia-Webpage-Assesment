                Whakairo In 1967, the first intake to the National Carving 
                School began the task of learning the disciplines of their Māori 
                ancestors. Among those students was Clive Fugill, the man who 
                would become master carver of the institute today. “I’ll never 
                forget that first day,” says Clive, “Our master carver, Hone 
                Taiapa, looked at us all and said, “you are here to learn the 
                art to pass it on to generations. Keep it alive for we could 
                lose our identity.” It was exciting to be playing such an 
                important role to save Māori art,” says Clive, “everyone has a 
                reason in life. This was my reason. And that’s why I’m still 
                here over 40 years later. If we lose our arts and crafts we lose 
                our identity.” Today fulltime carving students study for three 
                years at the national carving school, under the guidance of 
                those, such as Clive Fugill and James Rickard, master carvers 
                at Te Puia who were once institute carving students themselves.
                The protruding tongue, as used in the haka (war dance), is 
                intended as a symbol of defiance, determination and strength, 
                however in many carvings it can also symbolize the oral nature 
                in which information was passed on from generation to 
                generation. Here at Te Puia we offer you the chance to take away 
                traditional Māori carvings; beautiful handcrafted pieces made at 
                our National Carving School. Look for the Te Puia Official Mark 
                of Authenticity. We also accept carving commissions.
