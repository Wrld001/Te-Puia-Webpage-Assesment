            <div class="div20"><p>Harakeke (Flax) is unique to New Zealand and 
                is one of our most ancient plant species. 
                When our ancestors arrived to New Zealand they quickly 
                discovered that flax could be woven to make clothing, housing 
                materials and decorative tūrapa (panels) for their houses.
                Two native species of flax both come from the lily family. 
                Harakeke (common flax) grows up to three meters high and has 
                firm, long leaves with a fine muka fibre, ideal for all types
                 of weaving. Wharariki (mountain flax) is found along coast 
                 lines, growing up to 1.6 meters with softer leaves and less 
                 fibre than harakeke.
                At the National Weaving school, students are taught the skills 
                and traditions of a craft hundreds of years old. “I believe 
                weaving can only be learnt the old way - by sitting, by 
                listening, by touching and by doing,” says head of the weaving 
                school, Edna Pahewa.
                As well as learning how to weave harakeke (flax) and other 
                materials, students learn the stories and designs unique to 
                each iwi (tribe), as well as the Māori protocols associated 
                with weaving. These include planting according to the phases 
                of the moon and reciting prayers of thanks for flax and trees 
                used.
                Te Rito is named after the baby shoot that sits deep at the 
                heart of the flax. That baby is protected by two outside 
                shoots, the mother and father. Students learn never to touch 
                the inner three shoots when cutting the flax as they are the 
                nucleus - the family unit too precious to be broken. Without 
                these shoots, the flax will lose its identity.
