            <h1>Flax Weaving Schools</h1>
            <p>Harakeke (Flax) is unique to New Zealand and is one of our most ancient plant species. When our ancestors arrived in New Zealand they quickly discovered that flax could be woven to make clothing, mats, ropes, and baskets. Harakeke was used for centuries to provide everything from cloaks to kete (baskets), with weaving being a highly valued skill passed down through generations.</p>
            <p>The weaving process is deeply connected to Māori culture, reflecting the skills, stories, and traditions of the people who create these beautiful and functional works of art. The national weaving school, Te Rito, continues to keep these traditions alive.</p>
