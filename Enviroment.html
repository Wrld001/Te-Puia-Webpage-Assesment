                each with their own name, are found in the 70 hectare Te 
                Whakarewarewa geothermal valley in Rotorua.
                Our traditional Maori explanation of Te Whakarewarewa Geothermal
                 Valley states that this place was one of the area’s ‘Te Pupu’ 
                 and ‘Te Hoata’, the Goddesses of Fire, emerged from the earth’s
                  core while trying to find their brother Ngātoro-i-rangi, who 
                  was stranded on Mount Tongariro. As they rose to the surface 
                  looking for their brother, they left part of the fire they 
                  carried, creating geysers, hot springs and mud pools, creating
                   the geothermal activity that remains today.
                Our main geyser is called “Pohutu” which means “Big splash” and 
                erupts up to heights of 30 meters. Pohutu is semi-predictable, 
                as she plays 15-20 minutes after another of our active geysers. 
                According to Maori culture, geysers are viewed as gifts from the
                gods To the left of Pohutu (when viewing from the bridge) is the
                 “Prince of Wales Feathers” Geyser – named after Prince Edward 
                 Albert visited here in the 1900’s. It was traditionally named 
                 the “Tohu” or sign as it usually plays 10 mins before and then 
                 simultaneously with Pohutu and reaches heights of up to seven 
                 metres (almost 23 feet).
                The “Kererū” Geyser erupts every few days from the blackened 
                crater closest to Puarenga Stream. The fan-shaped jet can reach 
                heights of up to 15 metres (just over 49 feet). It is named
                 after the New Zealand Pigeon.
                Geysers act like a giant pressure cooker on earth, shooting 
                boiling water and steam into the air.
                All geysers have three components; an intensive heat source, a 
                constant supply of water and an underground plumbing system.
                As rainfall fills the intricate plumbing system below the 
                earth’s surface, molten rock rapidly heats the water.
                The water is under significant pressure causing the boiling 
                point to be well over 125 degrees Celsius.
                As pockets of water become turbulent, the pressure is relieved 
                by violently shooting steam and water into the air with
                tremendous force.
